# Deep Learning Image Classification Pipeline

This project demonstrates a deep learning pipeline for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The pipeline covers data preprocessing, model creation, training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning. It also integrates transfer learning for small datasets, providing an option to use pre-trained models for improved performance.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a robust deep learning model capable of classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The project consists of several stages, including dataset loading and preprocessing, model development, training, and evaluation. The code utilizes TensorFlow and Keras libraries, with a focus on deep neural networks (DNN) for classification tasks.

## Data Preprocessing

In the preprocessing stage, the CIFAR-10 dataset is loaded and normalized to ensure the pixel values are in the range of [0, 1]. To improve the model’s generalization, data augmentation techniques such as rotation, shifting, and flipping are applied. This helps create more diverse data and reduces the risk of overfitting. Additionally, the dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance effectively.

## Model Development

The model can be either a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or a transfer learning model utilizing pre-trained networks like MobileNetV2. The CNN model includes multiple convolutional layers followed by pooling and dense layers. Regularization techniques such as dropout and batch normalization are also employed to prevent overfitting and ensure better performance.

For small datasets, transfer learning is an optional approach where the model leverages pre-trained weights from a model trained on a large dataset (like ImageNet) and fine-tunes it to adapt to the new task. This method typically results in faster convergence and better accuracy.

## Training the Model

During training, the model is compiled with an optimizer (such as Adam) and a loss function (e.g., sparse categorical crossentropy). Early stopping is used to monitor the validation loss and prevent overfitting by stopping training when the performance starts to degrade. The model is trained using augmented data, which helps improve the generalization ability of the model.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

Hyperparameter tuning is an essential part of improving model performance. In this project, hyperparameters such as the batch size and learning rate are explored to identify the best combination for the model. Different sets of hyperparameters are tested, and the model with the highest validation accuracy is selected.

## Model Evaluation

Once the model is trained, it is evaluated on the test set to assess its performance. In addition to the basic accuracy metric, the model's precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated to get a more comprehensive understanding of its performance. A confusion matrix is also generated to visualize how well the model performs across the different classes.

## Results Visualization

The project includes visualizations for the model’s training progress. Plots showing training and validation accuracy and loss curves help track the model’s learning over epochs. These plots are useful for identifying overfitting, underfitting, or convergence issues during training.

## Conclusion

In this project, a complete image classification pipeline is built and evaluated using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model is trained and tested with various techniques to achieve a high classification performance. By exploring different architectures, regularization methods, and hyperparameter settings, the project provides a comprehensive overview of best practices for deep learning image classification tasks.
