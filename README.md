Steps to Run the Code
Environment Setup
Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies. Ensure Python 3.x is installed.

Dataset Loading and Preprocessing
The dataset (CIFAR-10) is loaded and preprocessed with normalization and data augmentation techniques.

Python
x_train, x_val, x_test, y_train, y_val, y_test, datagen = load_and_preprocess_dataset()
Model Development
The model can be built using either a custom CNN or by utilizing transfer learning with pre-trained models like MobileNetV2.

Python
model = build_cnn_model()  # For custom CNN
model = build_transfer_learning_model()  # For transfer learning
Model Training
Train the model using the train_model() function. It uses data augmentation and early stopping to prevent overfitting.

Python
model, history = train_model(model, datagen, x_train, y_train, x_val, y_val)
Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance on the test set and visualize the results using training/validation loss and accuracy curves.

Python
evaluate_model(model, x_test, y_test)
plot_history(history)
Hyperparameter Tuning
(Optional) Explore hyperparameter tuning for optimizing the model's performance using different batch sizes and learning rates.

Python
best_model = hyperparameter_tuning(datagen, x_train, y_train, x_val, y_val)
Model Evaluation (Extended)
Evaluate the model using additional metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, and visualize a confusion matrix.

Python
evaluate_model(model, x_test, y_test, class_names)
Results
After training the model, you can evaluate the performance using metrics such as:

Accuracy
Precision, recall, and F1 score
Confusion matrix
You can also visualize training and validation accuracy/loss curves to understand the model's learning behavior.
